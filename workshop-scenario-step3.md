# Legacy Code Modernization Workshop

## Step 3: Process of the COBOL code to a New Language

### Task 1: Ask GitHub Copilot to convert the code to Java

1. Open Copilot Chat with `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`I` or `Cmd`+`Alt`+`I`.

2. Ask GitHub Copilot for the following:

   ```plaintext
   I am looking to migrate a COBOL program to Java. I recognize that COBOL and Java have different concepts as programming languages. Therefore, I believe that I need to consider what steps I should take when converting and migrating source code. For example, I believe there are a number of considerations, such as how classes should be thought of in Java from the COBOL language, and how to migrate COBOL subroutines and copy clauses to Java. So, what are the steps to migrate from COBOL to Java?
   ```

<details>
<summary>3. GitHub Copilot Sample Response</summary>
Migrating a COBOL program to Java involves several steps to ensure that the concepts and structures in COBOL are appropriately mapped to Java. Here are the steps you should consider:

### 1. Project Planning and Preparation

- **Inventory of Codebase**:
  - Identify and document all COBOL programs, copybooks, and external dependencies.

- **Define Scope and Goals**:
  - Determine the scope of the migration and set goals (e.g., performance improvement, maintainability).

### 2. Mapping COBOL Concepts to Java

- **Program Structure**:
  - Map each COBOL program to a Java class. The `IDENTIFICATION DIVISION` in COBOL corresponds to the class declaration in Java.

- **Data Definitions**:
  - Convert data items defined in the `DATA DIVISION` to Java fields. Map COBOL data types to Java data types.

- **Subroutines**:
  - Convert COBOL subroutines (e.g., `PERFORM` and `CALL` statements) to Java methods. Treat subroutine arguments as method parameters.

- **COPYBOOK**:
  - Convert COBOL copybooks to reusable Java classes or interfaces.

### 3. Implementation of Migration

- **Create Classes**:
  - Create Java classes corresponding to each COBOL program. Name the classes based on the program names.

- **Define Fields**:
  - Define Java fields for COBOL data items. Perform data type conversions (e.g., `PIC 9(3)` to `int`).

- **Implement Methods**:
  - Implement Java methods for COBOL subroutines. Name the methods based on the subroutine names.

- **External Program Calls**:
  - Convert COBOL external program calls (`CALL` statements) to Java method calls.

### 4. Testing and Validation

- **Create Unit Tests**:
  - Develop unit tests for each Java class and method to ensure correct functionality.

- **Perform Integration Testing**:
  - Conduct integration testing to verify that the entire migrated Java codebase works correctly.

### 5. Optimization and Refactoring

- **Optimize Code**:
  - Optimize the migrated Java code for performance improvements.

- **Refactor Code**:
  - Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

### Example of Converting COBOL Subroutine to Java

#### COBOL Subroutine
```cobol
INITIALIZE-EMPLOYEES.
    MOVE "E001" TO EMPLOYEE-ID(1).
    MOVE "Alice Johnson" TO EMPLOYEE-NAME(1).
    MOVE "HR" TO DEPARTMENT(1).
    MOVE 70000.00 TO GROSS-SALARY(1).
    ...
```

#### Java Method
```java
public class PayrollSystem {
    private Employee[] employees = new Employee[5];

    public void initializeEmployees() {
        employees[0] = new Employee("E001", "Alice Johnson", "HR", 70000.00);
        // Initialize other employees
    }
}

class Employee {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String department;
    private double grossSalary;

    public Employee(String id, String name, String department, double grossSalary) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
        this.grossSalary = grossSalary;
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
```

### Detailed Steps

    MOVE "HR" TO DEPARTMENT(1).
    MOVE 70000.00 TO GROSS-SALARY(1).
    ...
```

#### Python Function
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, emp_id, name, department, gross_salary):
        self.emp_id = emp_id
        self.name = name
        self.department = department
        self.gross_salary = gross_salary

def initialize_employees():
    employees = []
    employees.append(Employee("E001", "Alice Johnson", "HR", 70000.00))
    employees.append(Employee("E002", "Bob Smith", "IT", 85000.00))
    employees.append(Employee("E003", "Charlie Brown", "Finance", 60000.00))
    employees.append(Employee("E004", "David Wilson", "Marketing", 75000.00))
    employees.append(Employee("E005", "Eve Davis", "HR", 75000.00))
    return employees

# Example usage
employees = initialize_employees()
for emp in employees:
    print(f"ID: {emp.emp_id}, Name: {emp.name}, Department: {emp.department}, Gross Salary: {emp.gross_salary}")
```

By following these steps, you can systematically migrate your COBOL program to Python, ensuring that the new application is robust, maintainable, and meets the original requirements.
